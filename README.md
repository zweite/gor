## About

Gor is an open-source tool for capturing and replaying live HTTP traffic into a test environment in order to continuously test your system with real data. It can be used to increase confidence in code deployments, configuration changes and infrastructure changes.

Now you can test your code on real user sessions in an automated and repeatable fashion.
**No more falling down in production!**

Here is basic workflow: The listener server catches http traffic and sends it to the replay server or saves to file. The replay server forwards traffic to a given address.

Check [latest documentation](http://github.com/buger/gor/wiki).

## Installation
Download latest binary from https://github.com/buger/gor/releases or [compile by yourself](https://github.com/buger/gor/wiki/Compilation).

## Getting started

The most basic setup will be `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-stdout` which acts like tcpdump.
If you already have test environment you can start replaying: `sudo ./gor --input-raw :8000 --output-http http://staging.env`.

See the our wiki and especially [Getting started](https://github.com/buger/gor/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page for more info.
